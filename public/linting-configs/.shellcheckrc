# Shellcheck directives allow you to control how shellcheck works, and take the form of comments in files:
# see: https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Directive

# Review 'man shellcheck' section 'RC FILES' for instructions on adding directives.

# For a description of any error/warning code, e.g. SC2230, SC2086, SC2204, etc; 
  # see: - https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/<error/warning code here>

# Allow using `which` since it gives full paths and is common enough
